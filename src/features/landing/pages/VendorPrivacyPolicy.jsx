          The data collected through the Vendor App is used to enable and manage your services on
          KeyRoute. This includes listing your buses for booking, showing availability to users, confirming
          trips, tracking performance, managing payments and commission settlements, and handling
          customer communications. We may also use this information to improve the app experience,

          We do not sell your information to any third party. However, relevant data (such as bus type,

          (HTTPS), secure servers, password protection, and access control systems. While we implement
          robust security measures, we cannot guarantee complete protection due to the nature of digital
